#  Flutter Mobile Cookbook 

## Project Description

**Mobile Cookbook** is a mobile application designed to help busy students make delicious and affordable meals using the ingredients they already have in their fridge. With a focus on simplicity and user-friendliness, Fridge Fixer allows users to scan their fridge contents, search for recipes based on available ingredients, generate shopping lists, and engage with a community of fellow student chefs for inspiration and knowledge exchange.
